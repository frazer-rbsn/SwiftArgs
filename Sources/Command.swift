/**
 So I heard you like commands...
 
 In the command line, subcommands can be used after a command. The subcommand must come AFTER any required arguments
 the command has.
 
 Subcommands are themselves Commands and the command logic is recursive, i.e. subcommands
 are processed in the same way as commands. They too can have options and required arguments.
 Chaining commands like this can be useful for more complex operations, or reusable command models.
 
 For example, you could have a Command model called "NewCommand" with the name "new". You could
 reuse this command as a subcommand, e.g:-
 ````
 file new
 project new
 ````
 Where `file` and `project` are commands, and your `new` command is a subcommand for both.
